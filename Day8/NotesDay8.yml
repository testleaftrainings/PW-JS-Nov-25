| Feature           | Alt-Text                   | Test ID             |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Used for          | Images                     | Any element         |
| Purpose           | Accessibility + automation | Only for automation |
| Written by        | UI developer               | QA + developer      |
| Changes often?    | Rarely                     | Never (ideally)     |
| Playwright method | `getByAltText()`           | `getByTestId()`     |

Frames :
-------

Definition: An HTML document embedded inside another document using an <iframe> tag. Playwright allows direct interaction with elements inside frames.

Usage: Useful for automating pages that load content inside frames or nested frames.

Syntax:

page.frames()-> frames() method helps to get the collection of frames that is present in a webpage.

page.frameLocator(selector) → Locates elements inside a frame (recommended).

page.frame({ name | url | index }) → Gets the frame object to interact with.


Alerts /Dialogs:
---------------

Definition: Browser pop-ups such as alert, confirm, prompt, or beforeunload triggered by JavaScript.

Usage: Intercept and handle dialog events to read their message and accept or dismiss them.

Syntax:

page.on('dialog', async dialog => { ... }) → Listen and handle.

await dialog.accept([promptText]) → Accept dialog (optionally providing input for prompts).

await dialog.dismiss() → Cancel dialog.

Event Listeners
--------------
Definition: You subscribe to an event via Playwright's event emitter system.

Usage: Allows multiple listeners for the same event. No overwriting — all registered callbacks run.

Syntax: page.on(eventName, callback) or page.once(eventName, callback)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ What does page.on() mean?

Think of page.on() like:

“Hey Playwright, listen to this page. If something happens, tell me!”

So this part:

page.on(...)


means:

👉 Attach a listener to the page for some event.

✅ What is 'dialog'?
'dialog'


This means:

🔔 “I want to be notified whenever an alert box / confirm / prompt appears on this page.”

In browsers, these are called JavaScript dialogs:

alert()

confirm()

prompt()

So:

page.on('dialog', ...)


means:

✅ Whenever any alert, confirm, or prompt appears → run this code.

✅ What is async (alert) => { ... }

This is an arrow function (callback function).

It means:

 “When a dialog appears, Playwright will give me that dialog object in the variable called alert.”

So:

async (alert) => {


means:

- This function runs automatically
- alert contains the popup box
- async is used because:

We use await alert.dismiss() inside it
