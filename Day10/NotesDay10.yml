# Data Parameterization with JSON

---

### **Definition**
JSON --> JavaScript Object Notation.

Feeding test data from external JSON files instead of hardcoding values.
Useful for **data-driven testing**.

Usage
1. Sample JSON (testData.json):
[
  {
    "TcaseId": "TC001",
    "Username": "demoSalesManager",
    "Password": "crmsfa"
  },
  { 
    "TcaseId": "TC002",
    "Username": "demoCSR",
    "Password": "crmsfa"
  } 
]

Step 1:
Create a .json file under Data folder
Step 2:
Create a .spec.ts and import data from json file similar to the sample script.
Step 3:
Use the imported data in your test cases for validation.    
Step 4:
Run the test to see data-driven testing in action.

# Data Parameterization with CSV
---
### **Definition**
CSV --> Comma Seperated Values.

Reading test data from CSV files and running tests with multiple data sets.
CSV is widely used in organizations for bulk test data (rows = test cases, columns = input fields).

Usage
1. Sample CSV (testData.csv):

tcid,username,password
1,demoSalesManager,crmsfa
2,demoCSR,crmsfa

Step 1:
Install csv command :
npm install csv-parse.

Step 2:
Create a .csv file under Data folder.

Step 3:
Create a .spec.ts and import data from csv file similar to the sample script.

Step 3:
Use the imported data in your test cases for validation.  

Step 4:
Run the test to see data-driven testing in action.



# Data Parameterization with ENV
---
### **Definition**

A .env file (short for environment file) is a simple text file used to store environment variables in the form of key-value pairs.

It is commonly used in projects to separate configuration data (like URLs, API keys, database credentials, secrets) from the actual application code.

Usage
1. Sample ENV (config.env):

APP_URL=https://example.com
USERNAME=demoUser
PASSWORD=securePass123


Step 1:
Install dotenv : command - npm install dotenv.
Step 2:
Create a .env file under Data folder.
Step 3:
Create a .spec.ts and import data from env file similar to the sample script. 
Step 4:
Use the imported data in your test cases for validation.
Step 5:
Run the test to see data-driven testing in action.

If you need to set environment in the config file follow below steps:

1. Open 2 config files fpr qa and prod seperately
2. Paste the import script in the playwright.qa.config.ts 

import dotenv from 'dotenv';
import path from 'path';
dotenv.config({ path: 'Data/qa.env' });

3. Also Paste the import script in the playwright.prod.config.ts 

import dotenv from 'dotenv';
import path from 'path';
dotenv.config({ path: 'Data/prod.env' });

4. Now execute the 03-learntoReadENV.spec.ts with the below command in the terminal

--> For qa environment
npx playwright test 03-learntoReadENV.spec.ts --config=playwright.qa.config.ts 

--> For prod environment
npx playwright test 03-learntoReadENV.spec.ts --config=playwright.prod.config.ts 

Note you can also set this commands in package.json like below

"scripts": {
    "test:qa": "npx playwright test 03-learntoReadENV.spec.ts --config=playwright.qa.config.ts",
    "test:prod": "npx playwright test 03-learntoReadENV.spec.ts --config=playwright.prod.config.ts"

  }

  and excute the same with terminal commands like 

  npm run "test:qa"
  npm run "test:prod"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Test Annotation :
---

--> Control the behaviour of the execution.

hooks -> The execution flow before and after the actual test execution.
------
test.beforeAll --> before all test it will be executed
test.beforeEach --> before each test it will be executed
test.afterEach -->  after each test it will be executed
test.afterAll --> after all test it will be executed

Other Test Annotation
---

test.only --> focus on a specific test.
test.skip --> ignore the test from execution
test.fixme --> track and know failures that are yet tp be fixed
test.fail --> for negative testing --> test has to fail is the expectation
test.slow --> double the timeout of the tests execution --> 30 s --> 60 s for the entire test execution
test.describe --> grouping the test depending on the status of the other test.
test.use -->use the functionalities
