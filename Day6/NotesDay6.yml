    ----------

        name: 'firefox',
      use: { browserName:"firefox", 
        viewport:{ width: 1920, height: 1080 }, // disable the deafult 1280x720
        launchOptions:{
          args:['--start-maximized'],
        }
}
}





Assertions :
-----------
Use expect() library for assertions

expect library meaning - to expect something

5 types of Assertions in Playwright:
--------------------------------------

1. Generic Assertion.

Assertions on variables or values, not directly tied to UI elements.

toBe – Checks strict equality (===) between two values.
toEqual – Checks deep equality of objects/arrays/values.
toContain – Checks whether a value/substring exists inside an array/string.
toBeTruthy – Passes if the value is considered true in JavaScript.
toBeFalsy – Passes if the value is considered false in JavaScript.
toBeGreaterThan – Checks if a number is greater than another number.


2. Locator Assertion.
Assertions performed on UI elements indentified using locators

- toBeVisible()- checks if the element is visible on the page.
- toBeEnabled()- checks if the element is enabled and can be interacted with.
- toBeEditable()- checks if the element is editable, such as input fields.

3. Page Assertion.

Assertions made on the page object , such as URL and title.

toHaveURL(url) - checks if the current page URL matches the expected URL.
toHaveTitle() - checks if the page title matches the expected title.

4. Snapshot Assertions. --> Visual Regression testing
Assertions comparing two visual elments from the UI particular

5. API refernce Assertions. --> REST API 
Assertions used check your API reponses 


Based on Functionality 
--------------------

1. Auto retry assertion.
2. Non-retry assetion.


Hard Assertion.--> It will abruptly stop your execution.
Soft Assertion. --> Informing that he assertion has failed and it will not stop execution it will move to next  part of execution.




Negating matchers

In general, we can expect the opposite to be true by adding a .not to the front of the matchers:

expect(value).not.toEqual(0);
await expect(locator).not.toContainText('some text');
